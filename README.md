# 5G-MIMO-Antenna
This project work proposes a four-port MIMO antenna for the sub-6 GHz 5G applications.
The four identical elements of the proposed MIMO antenna are placed strategically on both sides of a square-shaped FR4 substrate to realize both space and pattern diversities along with better isolation between the ports.
One pair of oppositely placed antennas is orthogonal to another pair of antennas that are placed on the opposite side of the dielectric substrate.
Further, four partial cuts are included along the diagonals of the substrate to ensure reduced mutual coupling among the antenna elements.
Each antenna element is a rectangular monopole patch of length 27.92 mm, and width of 21.48 mm, with its corners truncated to make the proposed design resonate at the desired frequency band.
The proposed antenna element operates across 1.45 GHz to 4.50 GHz, dedicated for Sub-6 GHz 5G communication applications.
It offers more than 15 dB isolation throughout the operating band and also exhibits a better envelope correlation coefficient (ECC < 0.02) and diversity gain (> 9.5 dB).
Significant design parameters are finalized through some parametric studies.
The proposed structure is fabricated and measured. The measured S-parameters are in good agreement with their simulated counterparts.
